            <td><pre>Mount Fuji Last Erupted in 1707,
the consequences of this eruption included a large scale famine caused by the tephra coating crops,
this cause the farmers to deposit the tephra into large piles, which were washed away by the rain causing
the rivers to get shallower and natural dams to form, which after heavy rainfall were broken by an avalance of ash
and mud, which resulted in large flooding in the Ashigara Plain, it is estimated that this killed many people
and flooded the fields causing the aformentioned famine.
